 Titanic Survival Prediction (ML Project)

This is a Machine Learning classification project to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features like age, sex, fare, class, etc.

 Project Overview
- Trained a Logistic Regression model using scikit-learn
- Dataset: Titanic dataset from seaborn
- Accuracy: ~80% on test set

 Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib (optional for visualization)

 How to Run
1. Open titanic_prediction.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
2. Run all cells step-by-step
3. Youâ€™ll see accuracy and a confusion matrix for evaluation

 Features Used
- Age
- Fare
- Sex (encoded)
- Class, Embarkation (encoded)

 ðŸ“Š Model Used
- Logistic Regression (binary classification)

âœ… Final Result
Model achieved ~80% accuracy with simple preprocessing and encoding.
